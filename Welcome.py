 This tool is designed to assist you in tailoring your CV to a specific position you're interested in pursuing.

## How to Begin?
- Begin by uploading your PDF CV in the sidebar.
- Paste the job details into the sidebar. (Include only the information you want to optimize your CV based on)
- Choose a method (from the sidebar) and navigate to its respective page.

## Currently, there are two methods available:
1. The first method involves providing your CV and position details when interacting with the Language Model with a single prompt.
   - You can adjust the prompt on the method page.
2. The second method entails requesting assistance from a Language Model agent to represent you.
   - You can refine your intent on the method page.

### Important Note:
   - This tool utilizes generative AI in a basic manner, and there are no guarantees for the output accuracy.
   - This tool is free to use by providing your own OpenAI key, however if you keep the API key field empty i will store your input and the prompt used for exploration purpose.

## Looking for a job?
I'm continuously exploring new methods to improve this tool. Would like to prove your skills? contribute to the code.
Additioanly, If you have any suggestions or ideas, please feel free to reach out to me at erlichsefi@gmail.com.
